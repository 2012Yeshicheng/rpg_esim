## Features

- Accurate event simulation, guaranteed by the tight integration between the rendering engine and the event simulator
- IMU simulation
- Support for multi-camera systems
- Ground truth camera poses, IMU biases, angular/linear velocities, depth maps, and optic flow maps
- Support for camera distortion
- Different C+/C- contrast thresholds
- Basic noise simulation for event cameras (based on additive Gaussian noise on the contrast threshold)
- Motion blur simulation
- Publish to ROS and/or save data to rosbag
